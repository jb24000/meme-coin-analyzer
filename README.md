## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Locally
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/meme-coin-analyzer.git
cd meme-coin-analyzer

# Open in browser
open index.html
# or
python -m http.server 8000  # Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Live Demo
Visit the live demo: [https://yourusername.github.io/meme-coin-analyzer](https://jb24000.github.io/meme-coin-analyzer)

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Analysis
1. **Enter Contract Address** - Input the token's contract address
2. **Click Analyze** - Wait for the comprehensive analysis to complete
3. **Review Metrics** - Examine liquidity, uniqueness, smart money, and risk scores
4. **Check Overall Score** - View the AI-calculated risk/reward rating

### Performance Tracking
1. **Add Tracking Data** - Enter days since launch, market cap, migration status
2. **Monitor Performance** - Track actual token performance over time
3. **Record Outcomes** - Mark tokens as successful (10x+), failed (50%+ loss), or monitoring
4. **Improve Accuracy** - The AI learns from your tracking data to improve future predictions

### Understanding Scores

| Score Range | Risk Level | Interpretation |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 80-100 | Low Risk | Strong fundamentals, higher success probability |
| 60-79 | Medium Risk | Mixed signals, standard due diligence required |
| 40-59 | High Risk | Multiple concerns, careful analysis needed |
| 0-39 | Very High Risk | Significant red flags, extreme caution advised |
